# Introduction:
This Mod is to update the regular potentioneter-based break input from the Logitech G92x based ffb wheels. I own an g920, so all instructions will generally base on this wheel.

After some research a combination of a loadcell with a driverboard (HX711) and a regular ESP32 should do most of the trick.
Most of this project will be based of the research of XXXXXXX who did a great job 6 years ago. When compiling his program i got errors and so i thougt about giving the old approach an overhaul by reviewing the code to be readable and easy and most important to change the initialization prozess from bluetooth serial to an lightweigt webserver baser approach.
